# Welcome to nickbranchbrick
This branch is where I try out very simple code.
Once I've got the hang of it, I then put it in the code in nickbranch.
The idea is to keep nickbranch clean, while having a separate test directory.
But I'd also like to save this in the main repo, hence this branch.
This particular directory has been created by git worktree.
